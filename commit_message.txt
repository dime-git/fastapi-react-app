Refactor: Migrate to clean architecture structure

This commit implements a clean architecture approach to improve code organization and maintainability:

- Create modular structure with separated concerns:
  - API layer (routes, dependencies)
  - Service layer (business logic)
  - Models layer (data structures)
  - Core configuration
  - Utilities

- Move Firebase integration to appropriate modules:
  - Config moved to core/config.py
  - Database operations moved to services/transaction_service.py
  - Formatting utilities moved to utils/formatting.py

- Update dependency paths and imports
- Add application factory pattern in app/main.py
- Update root main.py to use the new structure
- Update migrate_data.py to work with new structure

This restructuring follows best practices for FastAPI applications and provides better separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.
